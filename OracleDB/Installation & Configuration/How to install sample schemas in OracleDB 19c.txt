By default the zipped file of 'LINUX.X64_193000_db_home.zip', comes with 'Human_Resources' schema configuration files. But even this schema is not pre-installed.
If you wish to install all the sample schemas in one go, perform the following

1.  Download the 'db-sample-schemas-19c.zip' to your local machine and then ftp the zipped file to /tmp on the server.

2.  As a 'oracle' user, unzip the 'db-sample-schemas-19c.zip' in /tmp.

3.  As a 'oracle' user, navigate to $ORACLE_HOME/demo/schema and except the 'log' directory, delete all files and directories.

4.  As a 'oracle' user, move all the directories and files inside 'db-sample-schemas-19c' to $ORACLE_HOME/demo/schema.

5.  The sample schemas have files containing variables that needs to be replaced, before you can run mksample.sql to install the schemas

    As a 'oracle' user, execute the following perl command to replace the value of variables.

    Assumption:- your pwd is = $ORACLE_HOME/demo/schema

    perl -p -i.bak -e 's#__SUB__CWD__#'$(pwd)'#g' *.sql */*.sql */*.dat

6.  Login to database as a 'sys' user, and execute the following statements
    Assumption:- 
        1.  LSNR is up and Database is started.
        2.  Your pwd is = $ORACLE_HOME/demo/schema 

    a.  sqlplus sys as sysdba
    b.  alter session set container=samarth_db_sandbox;
    c.  @mksample syspassword1 syspassword1 passwordforhr passwordforoe passwordforpm passwordforix passwordforsh passwordforbi users temp $ORACLE_HOME/demo/log localhost:1521/samarth_db_sandbox
