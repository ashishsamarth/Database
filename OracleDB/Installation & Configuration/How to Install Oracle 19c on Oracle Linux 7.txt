1.  The machine must have a fully qualified name for the server.
    As a 'root' user
    check the /etc/hosts file and add the following line

    ip-address-of-the server    hostname

    e.g.
    192.168.1.125   ol7

    Note: The letter case (upper or lower) of hostname must be consistent across the board

2.  The hostname in /etc/hostname must be same as the hostname defined in /etc/hosts. This can be managed as a part of oracle linux installation itself.

3.  The advantage of using oracle 7 over fedora or Centos is, their is a oracle db preinstall package available for oracle linux with 'yum'
    As a 'root' user, execute the following

    yum install -y oracle-database-preinstall-19c

4.  You may want pull and install the os updates and security fixes, but its not mandatory. If you want to update it
    As a 'root' user, execute the following

    yum update -y

5.  Once the preinstall is completed, go ahead and set up a password for the 'oracle' user (This was created as a part of preinstall)
    As a 'root' user, execute the following

    passwd oracle

6.  With default install of Oracle Linux, the 'secure linux' parameter is set to 'enforcing', we need to modify it to 'permissive' as a part of db installation
    As a 'root' user, edit the following file

    /etc/selinux/config

    comment the line: SELINUX=enforcing
    Add a new line: SELINUX=permissive

    After the file has been modified,
    As a 'root' user, execute the following for the changes to take effect

    setenforce Permissive

7.  Create the following directory structures
    As a 'root' user, execute the following

    mkdir -p /u01/app/oracle/product/db/19.0.0/dbhome_1
    mkdir -p /u02/oradata
    chown -R oracle:oinstall /u01 /u02
    chmod -R 775 /u01 /u02
    mkdir /home/oracle/scripts

8.  We have to define some specific variables for oracle user, so
    As a 'oracle' user, edit the '.bashrc' under /home/oracle and add the following

    # Oracle 19c Configurations

    export TMP=/tmp
    export TMPDIR=$TMP
    export ORACLE_HOSTNAME=ol7
    export ORACLE_UNQNAME=cdb19c
    export ORACLE_BASE=/u01/app/oracle
    export ORACLE_HOME=$ORACLE_BASE/product/db/19.0.0/dbhome_1
    export ORA_INVENTORY=/u01/app/oraInventory
    export ORACLE_SID=cdb19c
    export PDB_NAME=samarth_db_sandbox
    export DATA_DIR=/u02/oradata
    export PATH=/usr/sbin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH
    export PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/bin:$PATH
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/lib:/lib:/usr/lib
    export CLASSPATH=$ORACLE_HOME/jlib:$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/jlib

9.  For the oracle user to be able to startup and shutdown the service,
    As a 'oracle' user, create following files, one for db start up and other for db shutdown

    # Contents of start_db.sh
    #!/bin/bash

    export ORAENV_ASK=NO
    . oraenv
    export ORAENV_ASK=YES

    dbstart $ORACLE_HOME


    # Contents of stop_db.sh
    #!/bin/bash

    export ORAENV_ASK=NO
    . oraenv
    export ORAENV_ASK=YES

    dbshut $ORACLE_HOME

    Assign execute permissions to the startup and shutdown scripts
    
    chmod 700 start_db.sh stop_db.sh

10. For the newly added oracle 19c variables to take effect, source the .bash_profile
    As a 'oracle' user, execute the following

    source ~/.bash_profile

10. Unzip the LINUX version of DB installation in to oracle home
    Assumption: You have the 'LINUX.X64_193000_db_home.zip' downloaded and uploaded to /tmp of your target server, and the owner of this file is 'oracle' user

    As a 'oracle' user, unzip the zipped file inside $ORACLE_HOME

    cd $ORACLE_HOME
    unzip -oq /tmp/LINUX.X64_193000_db_home.zip

11. Once the file is unzipped in $ORACLE_HOME successfully, run the 'installer in silent mode'
    Running in silent mode, allows you to feed variables / values as a part of command execution, rather than provided them as a part of db installation progress

    As a 'oracle' user inside $ORACLE_HOME, execute the following

    ./runInstaller -ignorePrereq -waitforcompletion -silent                        \
    -responseFile ${ORACLE_HOME}/install/response/db_install.rsp               \
    oracle.install.option=INSTALL_DB_SWONLY                                    \
    ORACLE_HOSTNAME=${ORACLE_HOSTNAME}                                         \
    UNIX_GROUP_NAME=oinstall                                                   \
    INVENTORY_LOCATION=${ORA_INVENTORY}                                        \
    SELECTED_LANGUAGES=en,en_GB                                                \
    ORACLE_HOME=${ORACLE_HOME}                                                 \
    ORACLE_BASE=${ORACLE_BASE}                                                 \
    oracle.install.db.InstallEdition=EE                                        \
    oracle.install.db.OSDBA_GROUP=dba                                          \
    oracle.install.db.OSBACKUPDBA_GROUP=dba                                    \
    oracle.install.db.OSDGDBA_GROUP=dba                                        \
    oracle.install.db.OSKMDBA_GROUP=dba                                        \
    oracle.install.db.OSRACDBA_GROUP=dba                                       \
    SECURITY_UPDATES_VIA_MYORACLESUPPORT=false                                 \
    DECLINE_SECURITY_UPDATES=true
