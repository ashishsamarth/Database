1.  The machine must have a fully qualified name for the server.
    As a 'root' user
    check the /etc/hosts file and add the following line

    ip-address-of-the server    hostname

    e.g.
    192.168.1.125   ol7

    Note: The letter case (upper or lower) of hostname must be consistent across the board

2.  The hostname in /etc/hostname must be same as the hostname defined in /etc/hosts. This can be managed as a part of oracle linux installation itself.

3.  The advantage of using oracle 7 over fedora or Centos is, their is a oracle db preinstall package available for oracle linux with 'yum'
    As a 'root' user, execute the following

    yum install -y oracle-database-preinstall-19c

4.  You may want pull and install the os updates and security fixes, but its not mandatory. If you want to update it
    As a 'root' user, execute the following

    yum update -y

5.  Once the preinstall is completed, go ahead and set up a password for the 'oracle' user (This was created as a part of preinstall)
    As a 'root' user, execute the following

    passwd oracle

6.  With default install of Oracle Linux, the 'secure linux' parameter is set to 'enforcing', we need to modify it to 'permissive' as a part of db installation
    As a 'root' user, edit the following file

    /etc/selinux/config

    comment the line: SELINUX=enforcing
    Add a new line: SELINUX=permissive
