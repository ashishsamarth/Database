As a part of the oracle db 19c installation, we did not do anything with the connection port (1521). This means, if the 'firewalld' service 
is running, then port 1521 is blocked for incoming traffice, unless traffic is allowed on this port.

To open a specific port in Oracle Linux 7
1.  As a 'root' user, execute the following
        firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=1521/tcp

2.  As a 'root' user, execute the following
        firewall-cmd --complete-reload

This will ensure that the specific port is opened, and firewalld changes have taken effect.

Now you can connect to this DB using the hostname, port # and Service name.
