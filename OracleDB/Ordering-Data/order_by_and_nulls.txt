By default, the NULL values appear at the bottom of results when they are ordered in ascending order, 
and at the top of results when ordered in descending order.

This behavior can be modified by using two optional keywords at the end of your order by clause.

NULLS FIRST: NULL values are shown at the top of the list, regardless of how it is ordered.
NULLS LAST: NULL values are shown at the bottom of the list, regardless of how it is ordered.

Example:

If you wanted to order by salary in descending order, but have the NULL
values shown at the bottom instead of the top, your query would look like this:

SELECT id, last_name, salary
FROM employee
ORDER BY salary DESC NULLS LAST;

/*
Output:
ID LAST_NAME SALARY
8 SMITH 62000
4 SIMPSON 52000
3 KING 40000
9 PATRICK 40000
2 SMITH 35000
5 ANDERSON 31000
1 JONES 20000
7 (null) (null)
6 COOPER (null)

The salary values are ordered in descending order, and the NULL values are shown at
the end
*/

To sort with NULL values at the top:

SELECT id, last_name, salary
FROM employee
ORDER BY salary DESC NULLS FIRST;

/*
Output:
ID LAST_NAME SALARY
6 COOPER (null)
7 (null) (null)
8 SMITH 62000
4 SIMPSON 52000
3 KING 40000
9 PATRICK 40000
2 SMITH 35000
5 ANDERSON 31000
1 JONES 20000
