How can you create empty tables with the same structure as another table?

This can be achieved by fetching the records of one table into a new table using the INTO operator while 
fixing a WHERE clause to be false for all records. 
In this way, SQL prepares the new table with a duplicate structure to accept the fetched records. 
However, there are no records that will get fetched due to the WHERE clause in action. 
Therefore, nothing is inserted into the new table, thus creating an empty table

SELECT * INTO Students_copy
FROM Students WHERE 1 = 2;
