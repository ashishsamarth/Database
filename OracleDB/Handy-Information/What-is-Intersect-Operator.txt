The INTERSECT operator helps combine two select statements and returns only those records that are common 
to both the select statements. 
So, after we get Table A and Table B over here, and if we apply the INTERSECT operator on these two tables,
 then we will get only those records that are common to the result of the select statements of these two 
tables.
