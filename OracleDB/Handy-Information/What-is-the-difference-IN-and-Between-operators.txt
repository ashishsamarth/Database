The BETWEEN operator is used to represent rows based on a set of values. 
The values may be numbers, text, or dates. The BETWEEN operator returns the total number of values that 
exist between two specified ranges.

The IN condition operator is used to search for values within a given range of values. 
If we have more than one value to choose from, then we use the IN operator.
