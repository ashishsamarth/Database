Assumption:- You have downloaded the latest version of SQLT from oracle support website

1.  Once you have the sqlt (compressed file) downloaded to the local machine, ftp it to the /tmp directory of your server as oracle user

2.  Navigate to /home/oracle, and execute the following command to decompress the SQLT utility
        unzip -oq /tmp/sqlt.zip

3.  Navigate to /home/oracle/sqlt/install, and verify you have a 'sql' file with the name - 'sqcsilent2.sql'

4.  Now, connect to database as a sys user
        sqlplus / as sysdba

5.  Initially, I tried to install the SQLT utility without providing the connect parameters, but it failed multiple time, the following is the only way which worked for me

6.  The installation will need the following parameters
        a.  Connect Identifier of your PDB
        b.  Password for SYS user
        c.  DEFAULT Tablespace  - USERS
        d.  TEMP Tablespace - TEMP
        e.  Main Application user- I utilized the 'HR' schema, hence my user is 'HR'
        f.  'T' this is related to licensing and features

7.  Since, I installed the utility on PDB, I had to change the container to PDB, via the following command
        Alter Session Set Container=MYPDBNAME;

8.  Now execute the following to install the SQLT utility
        @sqcsilent2 @ConnectIdentifier SYS_PASSWORD DEFAULT_TABLESPACE TEMP_TABLESPACE APPLICATION_USER T

9.  It takes about 5 mins for the installation to complete, the logs will indicate the following
        SQCSILENT Completed. Installation completed successfully
        SQCSILENT2 Completed. Installation completed successfully

10. Once the utility is installed successfully, the installation can be verified via the following sql code

        SELECT
        'SQLT version number: '||sqltxplain.sqlt$a.get_param('tool_version')||CHR(10)||
        'SQLT version date : '||sqltxplain.sqlt$a.get_param('tool_date')||CHR(10)||
        'Installation date : '||sqltxplain.sqlt$a.get_param('install_date') sqlt_version
        FROM DUAL;

        Output:
        "SQLT version number: 19.1.200226 SQLT version date : 2020-02-26 Installation date : 2023-01-09/10:23:08"
