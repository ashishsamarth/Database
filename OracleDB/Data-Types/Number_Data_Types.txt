There are many data types that can be used to store number values in Oracle. While you can store 
numbers in text-based data types such as VARCHAR2, it’s better to use number data types if you’re 
storing just numbers because

a.  You can perform arithmetic operations on them
b.  You can round them to a different number of decimal places
c.  You can aggregate them using sum, average, and other features


NUMBER:
NUMBER data type in Oracle is used to store numbers
It can store either whole numbers or decimal numbers, positive or negative numbers. The range of a 
value stored as a NUMBER data type is from -9 × 10^125 to 9 × 10^125, which means numbers that are
about 125 digits, positive or negative

When you define a NUMBER data type, you can define two things: a precision and a scale
    a.  Precision is the total number of digits in the number
    b.  Scale is the number of digits to the right of the decimal point.

Using different combinations of values for precision and scale allows you to store positive and negative 
decimals and whole numbers.

You can define a NUMBER data type by specifying the precision and scale inside
brackets (p stands for precision, s stands for scale):

NUMBER(p, s)

Example:
To define a number that has ten total digits, with three decimal places, you would write this
NUMBER(10, 3)
