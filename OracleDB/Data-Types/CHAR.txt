Oracle has a data type called CHAR.

This data type stores data in a fixed length, which means the value takes up the same amount of space regardless of the actual 
value being stored.

When specifycing a CHAR column, you need to specify a length value. This represents the number of characters to store in the field 
& must be between 1 & 2000 or (2KB)

Important Note:
1.  Values that are less than the length you define have space characters added to the right of the value to meet the length 
(similar approach as LPAD / RPAD)

This means if you store a value of “Oracle” in a CHAR column with a length of 10, the value being  actually stored is “Oracle, 
along with 4 spaces after the letters 
to meet the length to 10"

How to Define: Char(10) , here the number is the length of the string to be stored
