NCHAR data type is short for “Unicode character.” It’s very similar to the CHAR datatype, as it stores character data of a fixed 
length and adds spaces for shorter values to bring the value up to the length you have specified

It’s used for storing text values that contain Unicode characters. Unicode characters are a set of special characters that can be 
used in software. They have their own data type in Oracle, as they can often require more than one byte to store the character. 

Some examples of Unicode characters are

Mathematical characters, such as the Greek symbol that represents
“sum”: Σ

Many characters with accents: for example, â

The standard characters, such as the alphabet and symbols visible on a keyboard, can be stored in a single byte of data per 
character. This makes it possible to store in a CHAR data type, where one byte equals one character.

For Unicode characters, it’s possible that a character needs to be stored in multiple bytes, so a special data type is needed. 
This means that if you want to store these special Unicode characters, and you need to store them in a fixed length, use NCHAR 
instead of CHAR
