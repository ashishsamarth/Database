A join is a feature of SQL that allows you to view the columns from two or more tables in a single query. Data in a database is stored in separate tables, 
where each table stores a certain type of information. A join allows you to write a query that gets information from two or more tables and view the columns 
in a single set of results. Joins are often written in SELECT queries, but can also be done in other queries such as an UPDATE.

In SQL, you can add a join by specifying a keyword in your query. There are several different types of joins, each of which has their own keyword
A join in SQL involves a few things
a.  More than one table OR (The same table multiple times in cases of self join)
b.  A JOIN keyword
c.  Conditions that specify how the two tables are joined

For example:

Select emp.employee_id,
Dept.Department_Name 
from employees emp Join departments dept
on emp.department_id=dept.department_id;

/*

200	Administration
201	Marketing
202	Marketing
114	Purchasing
115	Purchasing
116	Purchasing
117	Purchasing
118	Purchasing
119	Purchasing

*/

Another way of writing the same join is by utilizing the keyword 'USING', instead of with the 'ON' keyword however this has some limitations as listed below
a.  The column name used for the join, MUST Exist and have the exact same name in both the tables.
b.  The columns selected for the join, CAN be a part of the select columns, but without the alias name

Select emp.employee_id,
Dept.Department_Name
from employees emp Join Departments dept 
using(department_id);

/*
200	Administration
201	Marketing
202	Marketing
114	Purchasing
115	Purchasing
116	Purchasing
117	Purchasing
118	Purchasing
119	Purchasing
*/

If we execute the following,

Select emp.employee_id, dept.department_id, Dept.Department_Name
from employees emp Join Departments dept 
using(department_id);

/*
--The 'department_id' column selected as a part of select section, has an alias of dept

This will fail with the following error:
ORA-25154: column part of USING clause cannot have qualifier
25154. 00000 -  "column part of USING clause cannot have qualifier"
*Cause:    Columns that are used for a named-join (either a NATURAL join
           or a join with a USING clause) cannot have an explicit qualifier.
*Action:   Remove the qualifier.
*/

However, if we execute the following,

Select emp.employee_id, department_id, Dept.Department_Name
from employees emp Join Departments dept 
using(department_id);

/*
This will return the rows successfully, since we did not use the alias 'dept' for column 'department_id' which is also used as the column to join the tables

200	10	Administration
201	20	Marketing
202	20	Marketing
114	30	Purchasing
115	30	Purchasing
116	30	Purchasing
117	30	Purchasing
118	30	Purchasing
119	30	Purchasing
