An inner join only returns results that match in both tables. Your SELECT query can use INNER JOIN keyword instead of the JOIN keyword
so, following queries, will return the exact same result.

Example:

Select emp.employee_id,
Dept.Department_Name 
from employees emp JOIN departments dept
on emp.department_id=dept.department_id;

/*

200	Administration
201	Marketing
202	Marketing
114	Purchasing
115	Purchasing
116	Purchasing
117	Purchasing
118	Purchasing
119	Purchasing

*/


Select emp.employee_id,
Dept.Department_Name 
from employees emp INNER JOIN departments dept
on emp.department_id=dept.department_id;

/*

200	Administration
201	Marketing
202	Marketing
114	Purchasing
115	Purchasing
116	Purchasing
117	Purchasing
118	Purchasing
119	Purchasing

*/



Select emp.employee_id,
Dept.Department_Name 
from employees emp INNER JOIN departments dept
USING(department_id);  

/*

200	Administration
