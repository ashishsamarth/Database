Issue: You are able to connect to a particular schema from SQL Developer using the hostname, port 
and Service name, but not able to connect to the same schema from sqlplus.

Root Cause: This happens, since the Listener.ora and tnsnames.ora is not explicitly defined in $TNS_ADMIN

Usual Location of $TNS_ADMIN is:-   /u01/app/oracle/product/21.3.0/dbhome_1/network/admin

Avoid manually defining the listener.ora and tnsnames.ora, rather use the 'netmgr' utility

1.  Once you are logged in as 'oracle', execute the following on terminal to open net manager utility
        netmgr

2.  A new UI would open, with the header 'Oracle Net Manager'
    Under the 'Oracle Net Configuration', expand 'Local'

    You will see, three sub-sections, 'Profile', 'Service Naming' and Listeners

3.  Expand 'Service Naming' and click on '+' sign
    Provide the following
        a.  Net Service name - orclpdb21c
        b.  Select the Protocol as - TCP/IP (Internet Protocol)
        c.  hostname - as hostname of your server where oracle db is installed
        d.  Port Number - 1521
        e.  Service Name - orclpdb21c
        f.  Connection Type - Dedicated Server
