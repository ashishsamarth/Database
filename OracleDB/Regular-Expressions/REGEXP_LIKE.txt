Oracle REGEXP_LIKE is used to perform a regular expression matching (rather than a simple pattern matching performed by LIKE)

Syntax:
    REGEXP_LIKE ( string expression, pattern [, matching parameter ] )

a.  string expression – the string expression.
b.  pattern – the regular expression matching pattern
c.  match parameter – lets you to change the default matching behaviour of the Oracle REGEXP_LIKE function (for example, change the search from case sensitive to case insensitive).

A regular statement to match rows having 'CD-ROM' will look like the Following

SELECT
    prod_desc
FROM
    products
WHERE
    1 = 1
AND prod_desc like '%CD-ROM%';

/*
Output

External 6X CD-ROM
External 8X CD-ROM
Envoy External 6X CD-ROM
Envoy External 8X CD-ROM
Internal 6X CD-ROM
Internal 8X CD-ROM

*/

The same can be written using a regular expression as

SELECT
    prod_desc
FROM
    products
WHERE
    1 = 1
    AND REGEXP_LIKE ( prod_desc,
                      'CD-ROM' );

/*
Output

External 6X CD-ROM
External 8X CD-ROM
Envoy External 6X CD-ROM
Envoy External 8X CD-ROM
Internal 6X CD-ROM
Internal 8X CD-ROM

*/

Their seems to be no difference in output.

Here's another variation where LIKE will fail, but REGEXP_LIKE will not

The limitation with like is, if you want to search a row with keyword(s), the keywords in the clause, must be written in the same order as they are present in the row.
But REGEXP_LIKE can handle this with ease.

SELECT
    prod_desc
FROM
    products
WHERE
    1 = 1
AND prod_desc like '%CD-ROM%External%';

/*
No Rows returned
*/

The same can be written using a regular expression a

SELECT
    prod_desc
FROM
    products
WHERE
    1 = 1
    AND REGEXP_LIKE ( prod_desc,
                      'CD-ROM|External' );

/*

External 8X CD-ROM
Envoy External 6X CD-ROM
Envoy External 8X CD-ROM
Internal 6X CD-ROM
Internal 8X CD-ROM
*/

The REGEXP_LIKE returned an output having keywords CD-ROM and External, irrespective of, if they are present in the same row as a part of the record using the '|' (pipe).
This is similar to egrep in BASH
